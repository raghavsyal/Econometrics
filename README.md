# Econometrics
This project is an econometric analysis of Indian crop production using 2017 district-level data. It compares Cobb-Douglas and Quadratic production functions via t-tests, F-tests, and R-squared to analyze returns to scale, diminishing returns, and the efficiency of agricultural inputs like irrigation and fertilizer.
